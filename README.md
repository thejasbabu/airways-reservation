# Airways reservation

This problem deals with reservation of seats on an aircraft.

Given a source and a destination, and a request for number of seats, the program should be able to reserve the required amount of seats
either together or different.

Depending on the type of aircraft, the seat layout might change. The seats can below to first class or economy section.
